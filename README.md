# **Wrap Up - challenge from codewithchris.com**
## A simple application showing cards with quotes, when you click on a card another screen will appear with more quotes from that author.

In this project, I tried the knowledge gained from the course on codewithchris.com, especially MVVM architecture, creating a JSON file, parsing a JSON file, ScrollView and NavigationLink.

The assignment showed the final appearance of the application and I had image assets available. I had to create the JSON file myself.
